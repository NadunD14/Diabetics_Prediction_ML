# Diabetics_Prediction_ML
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The project is implemented in Python and developed using Google Colab. It demonstrates the use of supervised learning techniques to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical diagnostic data.
