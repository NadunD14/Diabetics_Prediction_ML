# Diabetics_Prediction_ML
Diabetes Prediction Using SVM (Support Vector Machine)

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The project is implemented in Python and developed using Google Colab. It demonstrates the use of supervised learning techniques to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical diagnostic data.

Features:

- Dataset: Utilizes a cleaned and preprocessed dataset containing features such as glucose levels, BMI, and other relevant medical data.  
- Algorithm: Implements SVM for classification, leveraging its robustness in handling high-dimensional data.  
- Implementation: Includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.  
- Evaluation Metrics: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Highlights:

- Google Colab Notebook: Contains step-by-step implementation, making it easy to follow and execute in a cloud-based environment.  
- Modular Code: Clean and well-documented code for ease of understanding and reuse.  
- Open Source: Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve the project further.

How to Use:

- Clone the repository.  
- Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
- Follow the instructions to run the code and experiment with the model.

Applications:  
This project can serve as a starting point for those interested in medical data analysis, predictive modeling, and SVM-based classification tasks. It demonstrates the potential of machine learning in healthcare decision-making.
